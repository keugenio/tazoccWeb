During those times, we'll practice later at night or early in the morning however there are times we utilize the heat to train for harder races like the Queen Lili`uokalani Race in September.</li>
                      <li>Most clothing that you would wear to the gym will work. Bring LOTS of water and sunscreen and remember to bring a towel to dry off and extra clothing to change for your drive home.  It's a water sport. Deal with it.</li>
                      <li>The club can provide you with a paddle if you need it but most paddlers end up purchasing their own.</li>
