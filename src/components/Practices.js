                  <p>As the weather starts getting warmer, be cognizant of the sun.  Practices at the lake can get up to 110 degrees and above.  During those times, we'll practice later at night or early in the morning however there are times we utilize the heat to train for harder races like the Queen Lili`uokalani Race in September.</p>
                  <p>Most clothing that you would wear to the gym will work. Bring LOTS of water and sunscreen and remember to bring a towel to dry off and extra clothing to change for your drive home.  It's a water sport. Deal with it.</p>
                  <p>The club can provide you with a paddle if you need it but most paddlers end up purchasing their own.</p>

                  <p>As the weather starts getting colder, be prepared to wear a little more clothing when you paddle.  Some sort of headwear keeps the heat from leaving your body.  Layers are always best because you'll start to warm up quickly so long sleeve shirts with a jacket that can easily be removed should be considered.  Most paddlers will wear some sort of water resistant pants.  As for shoes, this is the ONLY time we allow them in the canoe.  Remember to bring a towel and extra clothes to change your clothing that may become wet due to the nature of the sport.</p>
